## Introduction
-   A Calculator is a device which performs arithmetic calculations on numbers. The simplest calculator can only perform Addition, Substraction, Multiply, Division but this calculator can perform Square & Percentage as well. So this asignment was centered on the Design & Implementation of a simple calculator to perform simple arithmetic calculations. The manual system is investigated in detail with a view to finding out the need to automate the system. Intrestingly, The end result of the simple calculator system made using a simple code in C has its ability to process the numbers with the operators and perform the arithmetic calculations.
